#About
A Huffman code is a particular type of optimal prefix code that is commonly used for lossless data compression. This is the definition from Wikipedia. Huffman was interested in telecommunication professionals as this coding method can greatly improve the coding efficiency. For a computer scientist or programmer, it is interesting as it is using greedy algorithm and priority queue data structure. Greedy algorithm is an important algorithm, priority queue is an important data structure.
